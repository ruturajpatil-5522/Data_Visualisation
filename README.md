# Data Visualization Project

This repository contains a Java-based data visualization project that utilizes the JMathPlot library to create graphical representations of mathematical data.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following components:

- **Source Code (`src/`)**: Contains the Java source files for the data visualization application.
- **Project Configuration (`.idea/` and `DataVisualizationDemo.iml`)**: Includes configuration files for the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment.
- **Libraries**:
  - `JMathArray-1.0.jar`
  - `JMathIO-1.0.jar`
  - `JMathPlot-1.0.1.jar`
  - `jama-1.0.3.jar`

  These JAR files are essential for the project's mathematical computations and plotting capabilities.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruturajpatil-5522/Data_Visualisation.git
   cd Data_Visualisation
   ```

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
   - Ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed.
   - Use an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for optimal project configuration support.

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Configure the project to include the provided JAR files in the classpath.
   - Compile and execute the `DataVisualizationDemo` application to view the visualizations.

## Usage

The application demonstrates how to visualize mathematical data using the JMathPlot library. Users can modify the source code to input their own data sets and generate corresponding plots.
